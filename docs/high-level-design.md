# High-level design

## Problem context

## Terminology
- **Service Provider:** An Agent that provides a service and communicates with *universal data agents* to access personal data.
- **Universal Data Agent:** An Agent that an individual client user has control of, which mediates data sharing between *personal data stores* and *service providers*, providing the user with self-sovereign access control over their data.
- **Personal Data Store:** A source/store of personal data that is accessible to the *universal data agent* via *data store drivers*. Note that the *universal data agent* does not assume that it has exclusive access to *personal data stores*, as they may be read and modified outside of this system.
- **Verifiable Credential (VC):** (See [W3C Verifiable Credentials Definition](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)).
- **Decentralized Identifier (DID):** (See [W3C DIDs Definition](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)).
